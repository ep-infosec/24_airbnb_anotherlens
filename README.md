# Airbnb.Design x News Deeply

To help examine how bias influences our worldview, Airbnb Design partnered with News Deeply, a journalism startup dedicated to providing in-depth coverage of the world’s most critical challenges. The end result was Another Lens,  a research tool designed to help creatives minimize the impact of bias in their work.

## How to apply them

It contains a set of guiding principles (balance your bias, consider the opposite, and embrace a growth mindset) and exercises that help creatives address skewered perspectives in their process in order to create more inclusive solutions.

Each of the cards below poses a question intended to shake up your thinking as you design. We recommend picking two or three at a time to reframe your work. You can also read more on the science and art behind each question. While this tool was made primarily for designers, we believe all creatives can apply aspects of it to their work. 

Next time you find yourself brainstorming, building, or polishing—we invite you to take a moment to challenge your reasoning. Together we can diminish the effects of bias within the creative process.
